# 100 Days of Python

This repository documents my journey to learn Python over 100 days. Each folder contains:
- **notes.md**: Concepts, summaries, insights or reflections for the day
- **code.py**: Code experiments, exercises, or scripts written that day

## Goals
- Master Python basics and build applications/projects
- Document progress and insights daily

## How to Navigate
Browse by folder (`day_01` to `day_100`). Each contains useful code and notes.
